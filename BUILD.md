# Building Fooyin

## Requirements

To build Fooyin you will need *at least*:

- CMake (3.18+)
- a C++ compiler with C++20 and coroutine support

The following libraries are required:

* [Qt6](https://www.qt.io) (6.2+)
* [QCoro](https://github.com/danvratil/qcoro) (0.9.0+)
* [TagLib](https://taglib.org) (1.11.1+)
* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) (4.4+)
* [ALSA](https://alsa-project.org)

The following libraries are optional, but will add extra audio outputs:

* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org)
* [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org)

Platform-specific requirements are listed below.

### Debian/Ubuntu

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install \
    g++ git cmake pkg-config ninja-build libasound2-dev libtag1-dev libglu1-mesa-dev \
    qt6-base-dev libqt6widgets6 libqt6gui6 libqt6svg6-dev qt6-tools-dev qt6-tools-dev-tools qt6-l10n-tools \
    libavcodec-dev libavfilter-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswresample-dev
```

### Arch Linux

```
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S --needed \
    gcc git cmake pkgconf ninja alsa-lib \
    qt6-base qt6-svg qt6-tools \
    kdsingleapplication qcoro-qt6 taglib ffmpeg
```

## Building

1. Using a terminal, switch to the directory where fooyin will be checked out
2. Clone the fooyin repository: `git clone https://github.com/ludouzi/fooyin.git`
3. Switch into the directory: `cd fooyin`
4. Run CMake to generate a build environment:

```
cmake -S . -G Ninja -B <BUILD_DIRECTORY>
```

5. And then build fooyin:

```
cmake --build <BUILD_DIRECTORY>
```

* Optionally add `-j$(nproc)` to build faster

A *Release* build is built by default. This can be changed by passing either 
`Debug`, `RelWithDebInfo`, or `MinSizeRel` to `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`

The following options can be passed to CMake to customise the build:

* `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS` - Build fooyin's libraries as shared (ON by default)
* `-DBUILD_TESTING` - Build tests (OFF by default)
* `-DBUILD_PLUGINS` - Build the plugins included with fooyin (ON by default)
* `-DBUILD_TRANSLATIONS` - Build translation files (ON by default)
* `-DBUILD_CCACHE` - Build using CCache if found (ON by default)
* `-DBUILD_PCH` - Build with precompiled header support (OFF by default)
* `-DBUILD_WERROR` - Build with -Werror (OFF by default)

## Installing

Once built, fooyin can be installed using the following:

```
cmake --install <BUILD_DIRECTORY>
```

This will install fooyin to `/usr/local` by default.
To install to a custom location, either pass it to `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, or 
use the prefix switch:

```
cmake --install <BUILD_DIRECTORY> --prefix <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>
```

### Notes for package maintainers

* Fooyin uses relative paths for linking against and finding it's shared libraries and plugins. 
These must be preserved for fooyin to run correctly. If you want to change the install location, 
use `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` as mentioned above.
