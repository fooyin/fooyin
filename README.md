## A customisable music player

fooyin is a music player built around customisation. It provides a variety of widgets to help you manage and play your local collection.

It's highly extensible with a plugin system and includes _FooScript_,
a scripting language for advanced configuration of widgets.
A layout editing mode enables the entire user interface to be customised, starting from a blank slate or a preset layout.

Only Linux is supported at present, though macOS can be built, and support for other platforms is coming soon.
